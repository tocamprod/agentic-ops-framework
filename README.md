# Agentic Ops Framework

This repository defines an agent-to-agent operational system designed to detect, diagnose, and resolve operational issues with human-in-the-loop control and full traceability.

This project focuses on:
- Controlled autonomy (no blind auto-deploys)
- Human approval as a first-class concept
- Learning through documented cases
